# TA Tasks

## Setup Demo Times

You will setup fixed time slots each weeks for demos.  Teams will sign up to demo their quadcopters in 10 minute slots.  You'll grade them according to a rubric on a simple 3-level scale:  doesn't work (0), works ok (1), works well (2).  There is a rubrics for each week's demo in the labs.

Teams will sign up for a fixed demo slot that they will use week-to-week.  You can set the range of times available, so they work with your schedule.  They need to be at reasonable hours (no earlier than 9am and no later than 6pm).

## Set up/tear down of Paste Assembly stations

During the PCB assembly labs and after we start quadcopter assembly, you'll set up and clean up paste application stations each day.  We'll discuss the exact timing.  This ivolves:

1.  Bring solder paste over from my lab's fridge.
2.  Assembling the items listed in the Assembling a PCB Lab `README.md`.
3.  Cleaning everything up _by the end of class_.
4.  Returning the solder paste to my lab's fridge.

## Grading

You will maintain the grade book.  This involves:

1.  Tallying how many lab reflections each student completed for each lab.
2.  Extracting the number of full checks and submissions for human review each student submitted for each lab. 
3.  Recording the grades for their weekly demos.
4.  Recording which students completed the pre- and post- course self-evaluations and the end-of class questionnaire.
5.  Maintaining confidentiality of course records.

## Organizing Parts and Tools

You are responsible for keeping the class part stores in good, organized order.  I'll impress upon the students the importance of not make a mess of them, but it's your job to keep them from getting jumbled.


## Completed before the first Monday of The quarter

You must complete these tasks on time, so leave your self time for things to go wrong/ask questions.

1. Do Lab 1.
2. Test remotes (QuadClass-Quadcopter-Solution/hardware/README.md)

## Due April 3th

1. Make labels for each component type with space to write qty (Look in `Part Labels`).  We only need part labels for the parts that very hard to distinguish -- LEDs, resistors, and capacitors.  For easily distinguised components (E.g., the power switch and the button, the voltage regulator, crystal, MCU, and balun) that come on tape, you can just cut them into the appropriate lengths.  The same goes for the throughhole parts (if any).
2. Prepare part strips for quad battery charger assembly.  Enough for 40 chargers.
3. Divided `README.md` for the PCB assembly lab into three documents:  `README.md` (general assembly instructions), `Charger-assembly.md` with parts and assembly drawings for the charger, and `Quad-assembly.md` for assembling their quadcopter (most content is already in the current  `README.md`).  
4. Update the table in `README.md` for the assembly lab that lists all the parts they will need to pickup for their quadcopter.  Create a similar list in `charger-assembly.md` for the charger.  Pull images from further down in the document as needed.   The goal of these images is to help them collect their parts, so the parts need to be readily identifiable.  Don't worry about images for the caps, LEDs, and resistors, they will be labeled (see #1 above).

## Due April 8th

1. Test 20 FCB. 
2. Dismantle old remotes
3. Assemble a test stand 
4. Build a remote
5. Do the programming hardware lab.

## Due April 10th

6. Collect all the data sheets of parts used in the FCB.  Put them in the resources repo in `Datasheets` if they aren't there already.  Note that naming convention:  <descriptive name>-<original datasheet name>.pdf

## Due May 8th

1. Prepare part kits (labels, etc) for FCBs.  40 of them.  These will form the basis for assembling their quadcopters.
