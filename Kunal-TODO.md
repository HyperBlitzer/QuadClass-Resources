# TA Tasks

## Due by Friday, Mar 29th.

1. Do Lab 1 and update the screen caps.

2. Do Lab 1 and check that git@github.com:NVSL/QuadClass-Eagle-Intro-Solution.git is a solution that matches the lab.  In particular, cam generation has changed significantly.  Have them commit a zip file of their cam file.  Run the solution to eaglint to make sure. 

## Due April 3th

1. Make labels for each component type with space to write qty (Look in `Part Labels`).  We only need part labels for the parts that very hard to distinguish -- LEDs, resistors, and capacitors.  For easily distinguised components (E.g., the power switch and the button, the voltage regulator, crystal, MCU, and balun) that come on tape, you can just cut them into the appropriate lengths.  The same goes for the throughhole parts (headers, and battery terminals.)  Note that we not populating the 14-pin headers on the BBB. 

2. Prepare part strips for BBB assembly.  Enough for 40 boards.

3. Merge `BBB-assembly.md` into `README.md` so that each type of part has the assembly drawings for those parts on the BBB.  THe high-level goal is to convert `README.md` from a somewhate general document about assembling boards to a document that focuses primarily on assembly the BBB.  So the assembly drawings, part list, etc. should all be about BBB parts.  

4. Move the sections of `REDAME.md` that labeled "Remote only" or "quadcopter only" to the bottom of the file. 

5. Create a nice-looking (as much as that's possible in markdown) table in `README.md` for the assembly lab that lists all the parts they will need to pickup.    I"ve gotten this started in `README.md` look for "BBB Part List".  Pull images from further down in the document as needed.   The goal of these images is to help them collect their parts, so the parts need to be readily identifiable.  Don't worry about images for the caps, LEDs, and resistors, they will be labeled (see #1 above).

## Due April 8th

1. Assemble and test 20 FCB 2. Dismantle old remotes
2. Assemble a test stand 5. Build a remote
3. Do the programming hardware lab.

## Due April 10th

6. Collect all the data sheets for quadparts_prebuilt.lbr.  Put them in the resources repo in `Datasheets`

## Due May 8th

1. Prepare part kits (labels, etc) for FCB.  40 of them.
2. Relable parts box with color coded labels.
