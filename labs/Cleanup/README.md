# Lab 12: Final Demo and Cleanup

## Demo

Demo your quadcopter for the instructor.

## Quad Photo

Make your quadcopter look pretty for a picture.

1.  Color-coordinate your propellers
2.  Take off any tape etc.
3.  Make your LEDs stay on constantly in whatever configuration you want photographed.  IT makes them easier to photograph.
4.  Cut off any zip ties.

## Check in your Code

You must check in the final version of your code and design.  We'll verify that it's committed and pushed.

## Return the Hardware
You can keep your quadcopter, but the remote and test stand need to be returned. You will receive an “incomplete” if you do not return your hardware by the end of the final period.

That hardware includes everything aside from your quadcopter and the crash kit you purchased. For instance:

1. 1 complete remote control
2. 1 USB cables
3. 1 test stand
    1. 1 FCB
    2. 4 motors
    3. 4 props
    4. 1 (or more) lipo batteries
